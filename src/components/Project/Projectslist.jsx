        "description": "Ramjet engines are air-breathing jet engines for high-speed flight, distinct from traditional ones by lacking compressors. They exploit the aircraft's forward motion to compress incoming air for combustion. The fundamental operation of a ramjet engine hinges upon the principle of air compression facilitated by the vehicle's forward motion. When an aircraft or missile accelerates at high velocities, the ram effect compels air into the engine's inlet. Unlike conventional engines, ramjets forego mechanical compressors, relying solely on the kinetic energy from the vehicle's movement to compress incoming air. This compressed air undergoes mixing with fuel within the engine, subsequently igniting in a combustion chamber. The combustion process yields high-temperature, high-pressure gases, which rapidly expand and exit through the engine's exhaust nozzle, generating forward thrust. Ramjets demonstrate optimal efficiency in supersonic flight regimes, where they proficiently compress air. However, their effectiveness diminishes at lower velocities, necessitating alternative propulsion mechanisms for takeoff and initial acceleration phases.",

The development of new products has already made great use of AM technology for prototyping. Today, components created by AM are used directly in the finished product, and in some instances, AM components are used as spare parts across numerous industries. However, the cost of currently available metal additive manufacturing (AM) machines for metals based on selective laser melting and the cost of part manufacture is very high. Furthermore, the processes used by these technologies produce waste metal powder, creating an adverse effect on the environment. As a result, there is an increasing demand for new techniques with environmental friendliness, high mass production rates, and low production costs. In light of this, extrusion-based metal AM techniques, which utilize the fused filament fabrication (FFF) approach, are a great alternative to the current laser-based metal AM solutions. The extrusion-based metal printing technique uses customized filaments with metal particles distributed in a sacrificial polymeric binder. A FFF printer is utilized to 3D print the green part. The polymeric binder is removed from the printed parts using a catalytic solvent or de-binder (depending on the step). The final metallic parts are obtained after the sintering stage. This article thoroughly discusses all aspects of filament fabrication, AM of green parts, de-binding, sintering, and post-processing of green and sintered parts in extrusion-based metal AM",
